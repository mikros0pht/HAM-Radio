	⁃	-SSTV
	⁃	-FSTV
	⁃	Tone frequency
	⁃	Tone amplitudes
	⁃	Two-tone signals
	⁃	Sync-based vs time
	⁃	Missed one major term here bc I didn’t finish taking notes so need to add:

 Visuals & Video Modes 

What SSTV receiving software to begin a new picture line? 
	⁃	Specific tone frequencies are sent to determine the “mode” in which the signal should be received 
What is the function of the Vertical Interval Signaling (VIS) code sent as part of an SSTV?

	⁃	To identify the SSTV mode being used
	⁃	
 What hardware, other  than a receiver with SSB capability and a suitable computer, is needed to decode SSTV using Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM)? 
	⁃	Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) ia.digital commercial broadcasting mode used to deliver FM-comparable sound quality to shortwave radio. DRM is vital alternative to AM shortwave. WinDRM is an amateur adoption of this mode. DRM uses COFDM (CODED ORTHOGONAL FREQUENCY DIVISION MULTIPLEXING) WITH QAM (QUADRATURE AMPLITUDE MODULATION)
	⁃	DRM is commonly seen with 10 kHz of bandwidth. Other bandwidths are used rarely
	⁃	Theres no special notch filter to remove sync pulses needed. Its just receiver and computer that’s it. 
	⁃	>> Answer: NO other hardware is needed.
	⁃	
 Which of following is an acceptable bandwidth for Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) based voice or SSTV digital transmissions made on the HF amateur bands? 
	⁃	3 kHz
 Analog TV:

	⁃	“Flying Spot Scanner” 
	⁃	Began with a technology that used a disc infant of a phototube  (refractionxlightspeed with start to end coordinates rationally within in a certain already multiplied solved expression (the expression being length times with of the photo tubes ability to hold needed lines because they didn’t over saturate the solution’s base number of the contemptuous travel ratio example a1b1 x a2b2 yadaadada= a16/ )so the first television that was sent (when Herbert hoover was sec of commerce) that signal was sent from around MD / Wash. DC area, that “camera” was a flying spot scanner and is on display at Hoover library in Iowa. 
	⁃	Electrical implementation with Cathode ray tube
	⁃	The picture is measured from corner to corner because the Cathode ray tube needed were square
	⁃	The original tv receiver was only about 5 inches
	⁃	
	⁃	The standard 30 frames per second had flicker so the system was interlaced to reduce the problem
	⁃	The standard 30 frames line after line per-second it came across with flicker so they changed it to a 60 cycle, scanning twice to get the 30 per second and then synchronized it to the electrical grid
	⁃	Synchronized with 60 cycle electrical grid
	⁃	Around late 70s when video recording was implemented then the synchronization started to die
	⁃	
	⁃	NTSC modified for “Compatible Color” using a 3.549 MHz chroma sub-carrier (needs crystal)
	⁃	Crystals were needed for this. For example a CW transmitter

	⁃	To synchronize the interlace an odd number of lines was required 525 represented approximately th same veritcal resolution as the horizontal resolution for a 3 to 4 Aspect ratio
	⁃	NTSD adopted this standard due to the aspect ratio for the tv pictures of the time
	⁃	
	⁃	
 
What technique allows commercial analog TV receivers to be used for fast-scan TV operations on the 70 cm band? 
	⁃	Transmitting on channels shared with cable TV. Needs to be an analog Has nothing to do with satellite (satellite is at 54) per NTSC.
	⁃	Cable tv channels only need an antannae and a station that’s transmitting to you if you have an analog TV set on the right channel
	⁃	The standard ham channel and the analog tvs frequency will lock onto the ham signal so even if its not the same ATV frequency its close enough most of the time 
	⁃	FSTV is not going to be modulated with a “computer sound card”
	⁃	ATV station band is close enough to a 70 cm band 
	⁃	The audio for ATV is not necessarily 4.5 mHz standard, so its often done using two meters. (Can you tune an old analog tv to the ATV band?)

How many times per second is a new frame transmitted in a fast-scan (NTSC) TELEVISION SYSTEM? 

	⁃	FSTV = 30 (like a motion picture rate)

In NTSC, how many horizontal lines Make up a fast-scan television frame?
	⁃	525 (not ac line rate, not 1080 high-def digital res

HOW IS AN INTERLACED SCANNING PATERN GENERATED IN A FAST-SCAN (ntsc) tv SYSTEM?
 
	⁃	By scanning odd numbered lines in one field and even numbered lines in the next TSC video?

What is the name of the signal component that carries color information in the NTSC video?
	⁃	Chroma (greek word for color)

What is vestigial sideband modulation?
	⁃	AMPLITUDE MODULATION IN WHICH ONE COMPLETE SIDEBAND AND A PORTION OF THE OTHER ARE TRANSMITTED (clarify)

WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES THE USE OF VESTIGAL SIDEBAND IN ANALOG FAST-SCAN TV TRANSMISSIONS?
	⁃	It is the duplication of the lower sideband and reduces it. So the reduction of the sideband (not single ) allows for video detector circuitry, but bc the carrier is there you can use a simple envelope modulator if you wanted

	⁃	6 mhz digital signal allocation but you can still have a lot of “pictures” contained within that digital version due to the processing of those
	⁃	The chroma sub-carrier information, the color-burst modulator, is phase-modulated, and although that information is transmitted simultaneously it doesn’t not impact it 
	⁃	Tv signal spectrum 

	⁃	Vestigal sideband = when you have a carrier frequency  you have signal above & below that frequency. For example, you have AM but it is filtered in such a way that you only get a part of such, so that you only get what is slightly below that frequency and then what is received is what is sent above that line of the frequency that carries it

	⁃	Luminance = brightness information
	⁃	Hue = characteristic of color

	⁃	Phase-modulated chroma
	⁃	Transmitter
	⁃	Segment


What are “Repeaters” ?
What is demodulating?

Slang/in-crowd speak:
“Crosstalk”



SKYWAVES & CONTESTING:

(Review from general & technician lessons / second or third time extra class review)

Radio waves are BENT or REFRACTED 

The earth is 8000 miles across
Ionosphere acts like a shell around the earth and it changes depending on time of day (day or NIGHT)
It is layered but without clear boundary between each of them

The radio waves propagate through the layers
Each boundary between them changes how the frequencies travel, some reflect, some are absorbed, or travel

Curved mirror effect

Light is an electromagnetic wave characteristically similar to radio waves

Every boundary away from earth around where the temp changes (that is a curved mirror along with the ionosphere layers at each point)

>>>>>Transequatorial - PATH that hopes over the equator and maximizes in the afternoon (best radio at this time. It peaks then)

At night: Aurora - first ionized layer - CW is the best for aurora
Between august and middle of December, there are meteor showers which sets up a charged stream of electrons which moves in straight lines “meteor scatter”
The digital modes are specifically designed for configuring it to such outside conditions between two people who both want to connect 
“Confirmable contact”

>>>“Meteor scatter operation” = frequencies are usual 10 to 2m using MSK144 (all choices) >> there will be a question about this
>>>Sporadic E = during the summer around the summer solstice around the end of June



Propagation View - Ray Tracing



Chordal hop -  

There are several hops radio waves can take bouncing off the ionosphere then the earth the back to the ionosphere then back to the radio waves into someone’s receiver

The ocean due to movement and motion can reflect (ping) that and bounce back the sound but can add distortion

Also, long-path propagation path is the long way around the earth to the receiving station that you’re trying to talk to. 20 meters is best for long-path But all can be used. (Has range though)

ACCESS TIME 

When accessing an electronic memory, such as in a microcom¬ 
puter calculator, the data is not received instantaneously. Al¬ 
though the process might appear to be instantaneous, there is 
always a slight delay, called the access time. When storing infor¬ 
mation in an electronic memory, a delay occurs as well between 
the storage command and actual storage; this, too, is known as 
access time, or it might be called storage time. If the computer it¬ 
self activates a memory circuit, the access time is the delay be¬ 
tween arrival of the command pulse at the memory circuit and 
the arrival of the required information. 

In small computers and calculators, access time is so brief 
that it can hardly be noticed. If much information must be 
stored or retrieved in a large computer, the access time might be 



much longer. This is especially likely if the computer time is si¬ 
multaneously shared among many users. See also MEMORY.

Absorption—
	ABSORPTION 

When any kind of energy or current is converted to some other form of energy, the transformation is referred to as absorption if it is dissipated and not used. Light is be converted to heat, for example, when it strikes a dark surface. Generally, absorption 
refers to an undesired conversion of energy. 

Radio signals encountering the ionosphere undergo absorption as well as refraction. The amount of absorption depends on the wavelength, the layer of the ionosphere, the time 
of day, the time of year, and the level of sunspot activity. Sometimes most of the radio signal is converted to heat in the ionosphere; sometimes very little is absorbed and most of it is 
refracted or allowed to continue on into space. The amount of absorption in a given situation is called absorptance, and is expressed in decibels or decibels per unit length

ABSORPTION WAVEMETER 

An absorption loavemeter is a device for measuring radio frequencies. It consists of a tuned inductance-capacitance (LC) circuit, which is loosely coupled to the source to be measured. Knowing the resonant frequency of the tuned circuit for various 
capacitor or inductor settings (by means of a calibrated dial), the LC circuit is adjusted until maximum energy transfer occurs. 
This condition is indicated by a peaking of RF voltage, as shown by a meter. 

When using an absorption wavemeter, it is extremely important that it not be too tightly coupled to the circuit under test. An RF probe, or short-wire pickup, should be connected to the LC circuit of the absorption wavemeter, and the probe brought 
near the source of RF energy. If too much coupling occurs, reactance can be introduced into the circuit under test, and this might in turn change its frequency, resulting in an inaccurate 
measurement. 

A special kind of absorption wavemeter has its own oscillator built in. Known as a grid-dip meter, this device enables easy determination of the resonant frequency or frequencies of LC 
circuits and antenna systems. 

ACCESS TIME 

When accessing an electronic memory, such as in a microcom¬ 
puter calculator, the data is not received instantaneously. Al¬ 
though the process might appear to be instantaneous, there is 
always a slight delay, called the access time. When storing infor¬ 
mation in an electronic memory, a delay occurs as well between 
the storage command and actual storage; this, too, is known as 
access time, or it might be called storage time. If the computer it¬ 
self activates a memory circuit, the access time is the delay be¬ 
tween arrival of the command pulse at the memory circuit and 
the arrival of the required information.
